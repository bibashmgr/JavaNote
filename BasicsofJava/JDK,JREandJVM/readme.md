> # Java Development Kit (JDK) :
__Java Development Kit (JDK)__ is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.


> # Java Runtime Environment (JRE) :
__Java Runtime Environment (JRE)__ is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.

> # Java Virtual Machine (JVM) :
__Java Virtual Machine (JVM)__ is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different from each other. However, Java is platform independent.

JVM performs the following main tasks:

* Loads code
* Verifies code
* Executes code
* Provides runtime environment
