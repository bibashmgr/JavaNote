> # ABSTRACT CLASS IN JAVA

A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an *Abstract class* in Java. *Abstraction*is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

__NOTE:__

* An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
* It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
* It cannot be instantiated.
* It can have constructors and static methods also.
* It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
