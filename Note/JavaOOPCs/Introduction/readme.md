> # OOP Concept in Java:
 
 Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts: `object` , `class` , `inheritance` , `polymorphism` , `abstraction` , `encapsulation` , and so on.

 > ## Object In Java:

An `Object` can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory. It is like a physical or logical entity that has state and behaviour.

> ## Class In Java:

A `Class` is defined as a logical entity which is the collection of objects. It doesnot consume any space.

> ## Inheritance In Java:

When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as `Inheritance` . It provides code reusability.

> ## Polymorphism In Java:

If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as `Polymorphism` .In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

> ## Abstraction In Java:

Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as `Abstraction` .In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

> ## Encapsulation In Java:

Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as `Encapsulation` .

Some of the  Naming conventions followed in Java:

Class:
- starts with uppercase
- should be noun

Interface:
- starts with uppercase
- should be adjective

Method:
- starts with lowercase letter.
- should be a verb.
- for mutiple words:: use lowercase for first letter of first word followed by uppercase for first letter of every words after that.

Variables:
- starts with lowercase letter.
- avoid using one-character variables such as x, y, z.
- for mutiple words:: use lowercase for first letter of first word followed by uppercase for first letter of every words after that.

Packages:
- starts with lowercase letter.
- for multiple words, it should be separated by dots (.)

Constants:
- every letter of the name should be in uppercase letters
- for multiple words, it should be separated by an underscore(_).
