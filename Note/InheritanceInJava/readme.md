> # INHERITANCE IN JAVA
*Inheritance* in Java is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features,fields or methods of another class.The class whose features are inherited is known as *Parent class* or *super class*.The class that inherits the other class is known as *child class* or *sub class*.Java doesnot support multiple inheritance and hybrid inheritance through classes but we can achieve them through interfaces.


__Syntax:__

```java
class child-class extends parent-class  
{  
   //Body of class  
}  
```

> ## Types Of Inheritance:

The different types of inheritance supported by Java are:


> ### Single Inheritance:
In Single inheritance,one child-class inherit the features of one parent-class.



> ### Multilevel Inheritance:
 In Multilevel inheritance, a child-class will inherit the features of a parent-class and the same child-class also acts as the  parent-class to other class.



> ### Hierarchical Inheritance:
 In Hierarchical inheritance, one class acts as a parent-class for more than one child-class.
