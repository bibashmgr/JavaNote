> # Abstract Class In Java:

A class which is declared as abstract is known as an *Abstract class*.
__Syntax:__
```java
abstract class ClassName{

}
```

__Points to Remember:__

- An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.

- It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.

- It cannot be instantiated.

- It can have constructors and static methods also.

- It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

> ## Abstract Method in Java:

A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an *Abstract method*.

__Syntax:__
```java
abstract void methodName();
// No method body
```
