> # Java Compiler:

The __Java comments__ are the statements that are not executed by the compiler and interpreter. The comments can be used to provide information or explanation about the variable, method, class or any statement. It can also be used to hide program code.

> ## Types of Java Comments:

There are three types of comments in Kava.

- __Single Line Comment:__
The single line comment is used to comment only one line.
    
    __Syntax:__
    ```java
    //This is single line comment  
    ```
- __Multi Line Comment:__
The multi line comment is used to comment multiple lines of code.
   
    __Syntax:__
    ```java
    /* 
    This  
    is  
    multi line  
    comment 
    */    
    ```
- __Documentation Comment:__
he documentation comment is used to create documentation API(i.e instead of .class file,it creates .html file). To create documentation API, you need to use `javadoc *filename` instead of `java *filename`.
  
    __Syntax:__
    ```java
    /** 
    This  
    is  
    documentation  
    comment 
    */   
    ```
