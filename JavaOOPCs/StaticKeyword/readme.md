> # Static Keyword In Java:

The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes.

> ## Static Variables:

If you declare any variable as static, it is known as a *Static variable*.The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.

> ## Static Methods:

If you apply static keyword with any method, it is known as *Static Method*.A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

> ## Static Block:

It is used to initialize the static data member.It is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.
